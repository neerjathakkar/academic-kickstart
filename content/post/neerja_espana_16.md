I can't believe that exactly one year ago I landed in Madrid for my Fulbright orientation! So much has happened in the past year, and as cliche as it sounds, I feel like a pretty different person now than I was then. This post will probably shine a little light on that.

Here are my reflections from my Fulbright year in a bunch of different facets:

On research/academic benefits:

- I made wonderful connections with the lab in Spain that I had the privilege to work at. Since academia is really small, I am definitely expecting to run into them at conferences in the future, or maybe continue collaborations as I see how my research interests evolve. Still Whatsapp with random research questions
- I feel more prepared for my PhD. I got better at reading papers and synthesizing important points from them, and I had time to take online courses and read up on things I need to learn. I also learned how to swap out the GPU in a desktop which was helpful
- Focusing primarily on advanced research in a new area showed me how much knowledge exists that I don't have yet. However, I think that realizing you have a lot to learn is an important part of the PhD process, and learning about the gaps in my knowledge meant that I could start filling them, which I did!
- I got to do research in a completely different lab and country from undergrad, so now when I go to Berkeley I won't see the way things are done at Berkeley as the only way to do things. It was generally great to get a different perspective on my field
- Immersing myself in research full-time made the frustrations of research much more clear. When you're doing research, you can spend days or weeks or months on an approach that ultimately pans out to nothing. While I had experienced this in college and knew it was a part of research, doing full time research made the extent of frustration I can feel that much clearer, but recognizing this also strengthened my ability to cope with this and showed me what to expect during my PhD
- While I respect all research and can recognize scientific merit, I realized that I care most about research that has an immediate societal impact, which helped me hone my research interests
