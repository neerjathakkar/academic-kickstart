Wow, so much has been happening, that it's been hard to keep up with regular emails. So here are some highlights of the end of October/November:

My parents visited! I guess they are coping with now being empty nesters by just having more excuses to travel?

First stop: Barcelona. They did all the touristy stuff, and on my birthday we went to Montserrat and then the Sagrada Familia which are both absolutely stunning, so my parents were basically like "happy birthday let's go to the prettiest places in the world". That night, we had some amazing paella and vino for dinner, and then I was running to the train station tipsy and thought I was going to miss my train, but turns out the train station was shut down due to protests (from the Catalan independence movement), so that was a bit of an adventure.

Some photos from our time in Catalunya:

This Catalonian wine is made out of volcanic ash and it is AMAZING

Girona would probably have been more fun if we watched Game of Thrones - do any of you recognize these steps?

The Eiffel bridge in Girona - he didn't just make the tower!

Montserrat is SO beautiful wow.

Next, my parents came to Zaragoza. Zaragoza isn't that big so I already felt like I knew the center of the city really well, and it was so fun to be able to show them around. Apparently my dad was at first very skeptical of Zaragoza, but after seeing it and doing the few touristy things you can do here, he "was very impressed".

Finally, we went to Madrid, which was so much fun. We had a nice dinner with the host families me and Nitya had when we did a Spanish exchange program in high school (I'm still close with my host sister), and overall had a great time in the city! I love discovering more cool things and good food spots every time I visit Madrid and Barcelona, which has ended up being quite a bit.

Some Madrid photos:

I had been craving good Thai food and mango sticky rice for so long. Most Spanish cities really lack Asian food of any type :/

I LOVE trains in Spain so much please ask me about high speed rail

Also, Toledo is absolutely breathtaking - would highly recommend:

Once they left, a lot of other events happened that made Zaragoza really started to feel like home, and led to a lot of fun memories were made!

I went to Logroño, the capital of La Rioja, the region of Spain where rioja wine is made. Aiko and I roadtripped with Miguel, one of my lab friends. We all bonded a lot singing along to random songs and going to a wine tasting together, tried pinchos typical to La Rioja, and it was overall a very lovely day :)

I met a girl from Florida, through mutual friends and we immediately hit it off. She's here through the *auxiliares* program, which is very similar to the english teaching branch of the Fulbright program. As much as I have appreciated and enjoyed primarily spending my time with Spanish people or other non-Americans, it can be really nice to have other people who better understand what you're going through. She also knows a lot of people through the *auxiliares* and erasmus programs, so I've met a lot of new people through her. One highlight of this was eating pizza that Italian erasmus students made...it was very good pizza.

I started to get closer to people in Zaragoza. Aiko's Spanish class + other friends hangs out a lot and we started doing frequent Sunday potluck lunches. I started going to juepincho (extra cheap pinchos (tapas) hopping on Thursday, 1-2 euros for a drink and food!) almost every week. My favorite vegetarian pinchos are croquetas de boletus or queso de cabra, champinones (grilled mushrooms with garlic and salt on bread), and any of the selections of cheese at a pinchos bar entirely dedicated to different kinds of cheese.

Thanksgiving made me feel a bit homesick, since that's normally the one time I'm always home, but knowing that I was going home for the holidays just 3 weeks later made it better. On Thanksgiving day I had dinner with some friends at a Mexican restaurant in Zaragoza (I feel like that describes the absurdity of this year and I love it), and I had a lovely friendsgiving with my new American friend and some other auxiliares that weekend where we cooked an amazing meal!

Finally, I started taking Spanish lessons, which has been extremely helpful for grammatical concepts I had forgotten. It's truly a throwback to high school Spanish! *(expand on this)*
