* Why make a website
	* Professional
	* Way to showcase projects and research you have done
	* Way to keep track of everything you have done, easy to forget
* Options for how to make a website
	* Wordpress/Weebly/Squarespace
		* Pros: basically no coding knowledge needed, don't have to worry about hosting/separately finding a domain name, will look professional and nice
		* Cons: expensive, limitations for what you can do
	* Static website generator like hugo/jekyll
		* Pros: a lot of control, easy to maintain and add content, nice for writing content, will look professional and nice with no effort on your part
		* Cons: don't have 100% control
		* Will write post #3 about this
	* Code from scratch/use HTML/CSS template
		* Pros: complete control, if you do this you will end up learning HTML and CSS
		* Cons: need to learn HTML/CSS, can end up being a lot of time to format things and maintain it looking nice as you add more content/modify things
* If you go for the latter 2 options, you will also have to choose how to host your website. I would recommend using github pages, since you can host it for free and and you also get a free URL.
