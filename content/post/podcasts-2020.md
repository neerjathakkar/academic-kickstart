Over the past year, from frequent rides on the tram in Zaragoza to lots of walks along the Mississippi River next to my house, I've started to really enjoy listening to podcasts. Here are some of my favorites:

**[Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first)**

Every episode of Up First has 3 short news stories and takes me just a little over 5 mins to listen to on 1.5x speed. It's a great way to stay informed about the most important current events without feeling overwhelmed or putting too much time into constantly reading the news.

**[Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch)**

This podcast, which is hosted by journalists of color, explores the intersection of different areas in society with racism.

**[Ten Percent Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast)**

I discovered this podcast before the pandemic, but as the world has become less and less certain it has become more and more comforting to listen to.

**[Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510308/hidden-brain)**

Hidden Brain covers human psychology in a very compelling and scientifically-backed way. I've learned so much about why we make the decisions we do, our biases, and interesting psychology experiments.
