Due to the pandemic, a lot of us who are fortunate to have jobs where we can work from home have been dealing with a new normal. This was an adjustment for me, but after I got used to it, these have actually been some of the most productive days I've ever had. Of course it depends on your situation, so valid to be distracted, I am too some days. Here are some things that have really worked for me when working from home:

First, a few things to think about in advance.

**Invest in your work space.** (Or, get your company to.) Buying a monitor made it much easier to stare at my computer for hours. I also bought an ergonomic keyboard, and I have a kneeling desk chair. My back feels the best it has in years!

**Try to have a distinct work space.** Then, only do work in this work space, so that you associate it with work and the rest of your home with rest and relaxation. I used to do work in my bed in college, and this was probably horrible for my productivity and my sleep. I'm lucky that I was able to take over the spare bedroom in my house, but even if you don't have enough space to physically shut a door on your work at the end of your workday, designate a corner as your "office" and only go there to do your work.

**Communicate with your family or housemates.** Let them know that during your work hours, you need to focus and aren't able to hang out. Come up with a system that works for you guys and gives you the space that you need. This obviously varies a lot depending on your personal situation, if you have kids, etc., but is definitely worth discussing!

Now, here are some habits I've found to be helpful.

**Wear real clothes.** I love wearing comfortable clothes, and my sweats have gotten a lot more use during this time. However, I find that wearing clothes that are a little less comfortable than, or at least distict from, my pajamas is really helpful.

**Don't let your phone in your work space.** I leave my phone in my bedroom while I do work, and only check it when I take breaks. It's amazing how much this simple action impacts my productivity! I also recently got an Apple Watch and appreciate the ability to filter only important notifications into my watch, so that even if I'm expecting something important, I don't need to have my phone nearby.

**Take frequent breaks.** Try to stand up and stretch at least once, if not multiple times, each hour. I take a little extra time after lunch every day to go for a short walk, and this time away from my computer often helps me think through my work with a different perspective, and give me a break that then helps me focus after.

**Give yourself set work hours.** Decide what hours of the day you're going to do your work, and then constrain yourself to these. I have found that this makes me much more productive when I'm doing work, and much happier when I am not.
